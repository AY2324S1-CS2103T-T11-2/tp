### Project: InterviewHub

InterviewHub - A CLI app for engineering managers to manage interviews and interviewees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find the interviewee based on the job description.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for the target interviewee based on the input job description with the command `find-job`.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently search for all the interviewees based on their job role. This would allow them to reduce the time taken to search it manually.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing `find` command as the interviewee can be search by either name or job description. The user has to pay attention to the command used to avoid wrong output from the search. By having an extra way to filter the interviewees, the user can save time with the CLI based system.
